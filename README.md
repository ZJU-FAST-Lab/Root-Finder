# Root-Finder
__Root-Finder__ is a header-only univariate polynomial solver, which finds/counts all REAL roots of any polynomial inside a given interval. (Please use the up-to-date master branch.)

# Feature

0. The solver is a __C++11__ [__header-only__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only) library, which is highly optimized on the 
premise of __instruction set independence__.

1. It only contains one header file "[__root_finder.hpp__](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Root-Finder/blob/master/root_finder/include/root_finder/root_finder.hpp)".

2. The interface only contains two functions. One is for __roots finding__ while the other one is for __roots counting__.

3. As for low order polynomials (linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials), the solver calculates their closed-form solutions. 
In this case, the solver only takes less than 0.25 microsecond for Intel i7-8700 CPU.

4. As for high order polynomials (order >= 5), the solver implements 2 different methods to find all roots. The recommended 
one is __Real Roots Isolation Method__. The other one is based on [__Companion Matrix Method__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_matrix). 

5. The __Real Roots Isolation Method__ uses [geometrical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_properties_of_polynomial_roots) 
of polynomial roots to tighten a given interval. Both Cauchy’s bound as well as Kojima’s bound are adopted. Normally, the latter 
can be tighter than the former for several magnitude in most cases. Technically, [Fujiwara’s bound is always better than 
Kojima's bound](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2003.10.019), while Kojima's bound is more numerically friendly and is tight enough.

6. The __Real Roots Isolation Method__ is much faster and much more stable than the __Companion Matrix Method__. However, due to 
truncation error of float point number, the former is recommended for at most 32-order polynomials, while the latter is only 
recommended for at most 20-order polynomials.

7. We perform benchmark example between our __Real Roots Isolation Method__ and 
[__TOMS493: Jenkins–Traub Algorithm__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins%E2%80%93Traub_algorithm) on two different platforms. The latter one is commonly 
known as the "RPOLY" algorithm. In the benchmark, all roots of a polynomial are required. For 8-order polynomials, 
our method is about 5% faster than RPOLY under Intel i7-8700 CPU. In general, __our library outperforms the RPOLY algorithm even when all real roots are needed__. Moreover, RPOLY is designed to find all roots of a polynomial while ours can handle any given interval. 
Therefore, __when roots in an interval are required, our method performs far better__.

9. The library is also capable of efficiently counting the number of roots inside an interval, of which RPOLY is incapable. For 8-order 
polynomials, our roots counter only takes about 0.2 microsecond under Intel i7-8700 CPU and 0.8 microsecond under Intel i5-5200U CPU. The time 
consumption for high order polynomial is extremely low as those low order polynomials which have closed-form solutions.

10. Only algorithmic acceleration is explicitly implemented in the code. Furthur instruction-dependent optimization can be done to get better performance.

# Interface

Only two functions below are needed.

__Roots Finding Function__:

    std::set<double> RootFinder::solvePolynomial(const Eigen::VectorXd &coeffs, double lbound, double ubound, double tol, bool isolation = true)

Inputs:

    coeffs: 
        Eigen VectorXd for coefficients of a polynomial. For example, the polynomial a(n)*x^n+a(n-1)*x^(n-1)+...+a(1)*x+a(0) can be expressed by 
        coeffs=[a(n), a(n-1), ..., a(1), a(0)].

    lbound and ubound:
        Open interval (lbound, ubound). If lbound = -INFINITY and ubound = INFINITY, then all real roots can be found by the solver. Note that polynomial cannot be zero at these two boundaries.
    
    tol:
        tolerance for precision, only works when order is higher than 4.
    
    isolation:
        switch for Method used. Default one is Real Roots Isolation Method.

Outputs:

    std::set<double> which stores all searched real roots.

Example:
    
    Eigen::VectorXd coeffs(6);
    coeffs << 1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0, 5.0, -6.0;
    std::set<double> allRoots = RootFinder::solvePolynomial(coeffs, -100.0, 100.0, 0.00001);

__Roots Counting Function__:

    int RootFinder::countRoots(const Eigen::VectorXd &coeffs, double lbound, double ubound)

Inputs:

    coeffs: 
        Eigen VectorXd for coefficients of a polynomial. For example, the polynomial a(n)*x^n+a(n-1)*x^(n-1)+...+a(1)*x+a(0) can be expressed by 
        coeffs=[a(n), a(n-1), ..., a(1), a(0)].

    lbound and ubound:
        Open interval (lbound, ubound). Note that polynomial cannot be zero at these two boundaries.

Outputs:

    The number of distinct roots inside (lbound, ubound).

Example:
    
    Eigen::VectorXd coeffs(6);
    coeffs << 1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0, 5.0, -6.0;
    int numRoots = RootFinder::countRoots(coeffs, -10, 0.5);

0. The "RPOLY" algorithm benchmarked comes from a modified version by [Helen Oleynikova](https://github.com/helenol), 
which originates in http://www.netlib.org/toms/.
